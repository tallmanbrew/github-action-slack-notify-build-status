## Releasing a New Version

Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when contributing to the repository. If you've forgotten to use conventional commits, a maintainer can include the prefix in the merge commit when merging a PR.

Releases happen automatically when merged into `main` with [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).
